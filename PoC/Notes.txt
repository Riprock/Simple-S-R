for the check if item is stored
first question it will ask is the what do we want to have checked
    Client Identifier, Project*, or shipping identifier

Thinking of breaking out the window into its own file and leave main to be for the processing.
Going to have to do some database design for the items

Dont worry about the slight format issues such as with DellOptiplex being one word as this just need sto be functional
enough to present  before I leave

Now that I think about it, I might not even want to do a interface because of how simplistic this is going to be. I am probably going
to do the database implementation though because then once the SQL gets written out then I can just call the same tables and what not during
the creation

*For Project, That will be implemented later

Update: 4/11/2019
I have figured out how this is going to come out. This is definately feasable, it just that school is getting in the way
but thats not a problem because this is just a project that I am doing on my own. This will definately be worked on when I am
out of school and when I have more time.
